    <p>George Lucas thought that the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han cold blooded. Lets think about the original scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunter is holding Han at gun point and says in his gurgly voice he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold. </p>
